# Geschichte Engine

## About

The Geschichte Engine (short "G-Engine") is a library written to create dynamic and animated Visual Novels. The G-Engine uses **TypeScript**, basic **HTML** and **CSS** for coding, **Electron** to create an executable Desktop-App and **ViteJS** as web bundler. At the moment the project is getting a complete overhaul to improve to code and make it more readble and developer-friendly. This repo contains the new code but it is still not "officially" published.
